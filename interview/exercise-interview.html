 <h2 style="font-family:din condensed;">Conversation</h2>
   <ul>
   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">Why did you choose graphic design as a career and do you see yourself involved with online design.</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">I got into graphic design through photography. I liked the process of editing photos and started to create dream like photo collages… I thought I was doing graphic design then. I started doing more of that kind of digital art and eventually started walking more into the graphic design world. I really like what I’m learning so far with web design and I will definitely not be steering away from it.</p>

   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">As a designer yourself, what other online designers do you look up to?</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">This changes a lot and is actually a hard question for me. I wish I had some names to put here that are cool and profound but I don’t. I need to dive deep into research on this so I will have a real answer if I’m ever asked this again. Based on some recent research and thinking “oh yeah, I’ve seen that and I like that” here are some designers: David Carson | Adi Goodrich | long time Shepard Fairey fan | I love Christof Neimann’s work (more of an illustrator).</p>

   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">How do you find the transition between digital and print design, is it something that affects your creative process?</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">Yes. I think even the slightest of things can affect the creative process in big ways.</p>

   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">what do you consider good screen based design?</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">All of the good elements of graphic design with the same love and care put into the interactive part of it.</p>

   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">As a developing designer has your perception about the web changed?
</li>

    <p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">Yes. It has become an important tool for research and I’ve learned how I prefer a good mix of online and physical research.
</p>


   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">how does the web influence design?</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">I think that since it is in everyone’s face all of the time, and has shrunk the attention span of people who are used to seeing constant advertisement, designers are both finding new/fun/extreme ways to advertise and doing really exciting things outside of advertising.</p>


   	<li style="font-family:din alternate;">Screen based design is a constantly developing practice with many influencers, in your opinion what do you think makes a good screen based designer?</li>

   	<p class="desc" style="font-family:din alternate;">I think a good screen based designer is someone who will also be a good designer in print and puts the same care into the look of a design as they put into the UI elements.</p>
