            Ripped albums and live performance videos from YouTube fed my teenage addiction to the loud and noisy music
            of my fathers generation. But before the low quality .mp4s was the CD. The tangibility of an album cover and
            the inserted booklets filled my time. These small experimental books were filled with rich abstract imagery
            that captured my attention. For my time capsule project I wanted to commemorate the loss of these tangible
            experiences. Moments that we trade for the convenience of digital media. By collaging these moments together
            to reflect nine of my favorite albums I hoped to capture a glimpse of these forgotten moments between
            physical and digital experience.
