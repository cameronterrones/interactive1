            Ripped albums and low quality mp4s fed my preteen addiction to the loud and messy music of my fathers taste,
            thankfully through the development of technology I was able to expand and explore my fathers music via the
            internet. For my interactive time capsule project I created a catalog of miscellanies videos and albums I
            used to to explore the previous generations angst. However in order to download all of these albums and
            videos I was forced to leave much of the content behind. The tangibility of albums, the emotionally packed
            visuals of live performances, and the files of these artists were used to commemorate a time where
            convenience robbed us of an experience.
